5 (spades) and 6
5 (clubs) and 6

2. If the deck is empty and the board has three cards left, must they be J, Q, and K? Why or why not?
Yes, because in order for an odd number of cards to be left it would have to be a K Q J because every time there is a match two cards are removed and K Q J can't be paired with any other card making them the last 3 cards left.

3. Does the game involve any strategy? That is, when more than one play is possible, does it matter which one is chosen? Briefly explain your answer. 
It is based on luck because no matter which pair you choose the replacement cards are what determine if further play is possible. None of the cards have mulitple matches possible, so the pair choosen doesn't matter.
